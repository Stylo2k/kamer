## Milestone 1 - API Design

## Milestone 2 - API Implementation

The processes that led to the development of our backend was initially quite challenging and somewhat daunting. This is because we had a great deal of freedom in deciding between what framework to utilise to implement our API endpoints. This led to a lack of direction and had us in standstill since we didn’t know how to actually start.

However, after lots of debate between Django and Flask, we decided to use the Django Framework. We did this because Django uses the “Batteries included” philosophy providing almost everything the developers will want out of the box.

For example, by default configuration Django uses SQLite which provides us an easy to set-up and fast database connection. Furthermore, Django supports a plethora of plugins most notably the RESTful API plugin, this enables us to quickly serialize the API GET, PUT and POST requests into JSON format for the app's frontend needs.

All in all, Django is simple to use and structure enabling us to focus more time developing instead of re-inventing the wheel.

## Milestone 3 - User Interface Implementation

We started by using django templates to display all the data but we decided to switch to React because it is more scalable. We also decided to host on a server (https://team13.xyz/) but it's capabilities are limited so using react was an advantage because all precessing is done client-side.

## Final Delivery & Evaluation

We find out deployable app to be stable and achieve the desired functionality
expected from the assignment description, along with additional functionality like map, other, temp

## Work Distribution

The work distribution was pretty equal we mostly met up and work together on the project. We made all the decisions together specially deciding on the languages/frameworks to use. Everybody did their best to make the best project possible.
